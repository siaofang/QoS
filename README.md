# QoS
quality of service datasets

We used five data sets, some of which were cited from research, and some were collected by myself.

1. The Google Maps dataset was collected by monitoring tool Postman from April 25, 2019 to April 30, 2019. There are six zone response times, and the last column is the average response time.
2. The WSDREAM is cited from Dr.Zheng's research. http://inpluslab.com/wsdream/
3. Paypal： We set up a website which contained payment function. The process of website execution was as following: The user posted a payment order and received response from service then sent payment information and got response from service. We recorded the response time of the call service, PayPal API,and network speed simultaneously from May 14 to June 7 in 2019.
4. DS5： We use this dataset from
    B. Cavallo, M. Di Penta, and G. Canfora, "An empirical comparison of methods to support QoS-aware service selection," in Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Principles of Engineering Service-Oriented Systems, 2010, pp. 64-70.
